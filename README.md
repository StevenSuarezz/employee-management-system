# employee-management-system

This is a simple CRUD web app using the Spring framework, ReactJS, and a MySQL database. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with Spring web development and explore the CrudRepository/JpaRepository interfaces in Spring.

TODO:
For further learning experience, I plan on packaging the react front end into the spring boot application, and hosting the app. I also want to explore dockerizing the application.
